### Simple User Profile API with Django Rest Framework

This repository provides a practical example of building a user profile API using Django Rest Framework (DRF).  
It focuses on the use of `Serializer` and `ModelSerializer` classes, demonstrating how to override the `create()` and `update()` methods for custom object creation and update logic.

Key features:
- JWT authentication implemented with the Simple JWT package for secure API access.
- Example endpoints and usage are provided in the `api.http` file for easy testing. Make sure you have REST Client extensions installed.

Feel free to explore and modify the code to deepen your understanding of DRF and JWT authentication.
